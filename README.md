# Letâ€™s Start the Project 

## **Part 1: Deploying the Flask application locally**

### **Step 1: Clone the code**

Clone the code from the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

### **Step 2: Install dependencies**

The application uses the **`psutil`** and **`Flask`, Plotly** libraries. Install them using pip:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Run the application**

To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following command:

```
python3 app.py
```

This will start the Flask server on **`localhost:5000`**. Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) on your browser to access the application.

## **Part 2: Create an AWS ECR Repository**

### **Step 1: Create a Dockerfile**

Create a **`Dockerfile`** in the root directory of the project with the following contents:

```
# Use the official Python image as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Set the environment variables for the Flask app
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Expose the port on which the Flask app will run
EXPOSE 5000

# Start the Flask app when the container is run
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

### **Step 2: Create a IAM User with the following policies**

![policies](images/policies.png)

### **Step 3: Store some AWS secrets in your GitHub Repo**

![secrets](images/secrets.png)

### **Step 4: Create ECR Repo**

Open your AWS Account and change the region to N.Virginia(us-east-1).
Then go to ECR and create repository:

```
General Settings:
Visibility settings: private
Repository name: <your repo name>

Keep the rest as default
```

After that go to your GitHub Repo -> Settings -> Secrets and Variables -> Actions -> New Repository Secret. Store the name of your Registry in there.

### **Step 5: Write a workflow with GitHub Actions and push the docker image to ECR Repo**

Open visual studio code and create a new folder with the name: .github/workflows
Create an main.yml file and put the following code in there:

```
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - main

env:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  
jobs:
  Testing:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.9

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m unittest unittests.py


  BUILD_AND_PUBLISH:
    needs: Testing
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: 
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build & Upload Image to ECR
        uses: appleboy/docker-ecr-action@master
        with: 
          access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          secret_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          registry: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY }}
          repo: monitoringapp
          region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}
          tags: latest,${{ github.run_number }}
          daemon_off: false
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ./

```

Push the changes to your GitHub Repo. Go to actions and on the left side click on CI/CD (your workflow name). Alert should have been triggered. Make sure the workflow has completed successfully! After that you should see the docker image in your ECR repo.


## **Part 3: Create an AWS ECS Cluster with Service & Task Definition**

### **Step 1: Create an AWS ECS Cluster**

Open your AWS Account again and make sure that you are in N.Virginia(us-east-1).
Then go to ECS and create cluster:

```
Cluster Configuration:
Cluster name: <your cluster name>

Infrastructure:
AWS Fargate (serverless)

Tags:
Name: <your tag name>
```
Wait then some minutes until the cluster is created.

### **Step 2: Create an AWS ECS task definition**

Go to ECS and click on Task definitions -> Create new task definition

```
Task definition configuration:
Task definition family: <your task definition name>

Infrastructure Requirements:
AWS Fargate
CPU: 1vCPU
Memory: 2GB

Task roles:
Task execution role: Create new role

Container details:
Name: <your container name>
Image URI: <your Image URI>    -> you can see it in your ECR Repo
Container port: 5000 

Tags:
Name: <your tag name>

Keep everything else as default.
```
After creating the task, click on ecsTaskExecutioRole and add the following policies by clicking on Add permissions -> Attach policies:

```
AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy
CloudWatchLogsFullAccess

```

### **Step 3: Create an AWS ECS Cluster Service**
Open your created cluster and go to Create service:

```
Environment:
Compute Options: Capacity provider strategy -> Use custom (Advanced) -> FARGATE

Deployment Configuration:
Application type: Service
Family: <your task definition name>
Service name: <your service name>
Service type: Replica
Desired tasks: 1

Deployment Options:
Deployment type: Rolling update
Min running tasks %: 100
Max running tasks %: 200

Deployment failure detection:
Uncheck: Use the Amazon ECS deployment circuit breaker

Networking:
Security group:
Create a new security group:
Security group name: <your security group name>
Security group description: <your description>
Inbound rules:
HTTP: Port 80 from Anywhere
Custom TCP: Port 5000 from Anywhere

Load Balancer: Application Load Balancer
Create a new load balancer:
Load balancer name: <your ALB name>

Listener:
Create new listener:
Port 80, Protocol HTTP
Target group:
Create new target group:
Target group name: <your tg name>
Keep the rest as it is.

Tags:
Name: <your tag name>
```
Wait for 10-15 minutes to create the cluster service!

### **Step 4: Check the app from the Load Balancer Endpoint**
After creating the cluster service go to AWS EC2 -> Load Balancers and click on your Application Load Balancer.
Go to Details, copy your DNS name and enter it in the browser.

## **Part 4: Deploy the Code to ECS by updating the workflow**

### **Step 1: Copy your taskdeffile.json file from AWS ECS task definitions**

Go to ECS -> Task Definitions -> Click on your task definition -> Revision -> JSON -> Copy to clipboard \
Go to VSCode -> Create a file: taskdeffile.json and paste the info that you copied.

### **Step 2: Update the workflow**

```
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - main

env:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  ECS_REPOSITORY: monitoringapp
  ECS_SERVICE: monitoring-app-act-svc
  ECS_CLUSTER: monitoring-app
  ECS_TASK_DEFINITION: ./taskdeffile.json
  CONTAINER_NAME: monitoring-app-cont

jobs:
  Testing:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.9

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m unittest unittests.py


  BUILD_AND_PUBLISH:
    needs: Testing
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: 
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build & Upload Image to ECR
        uses: appleboy/docker-ecr-action@master
        with: 
          access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          secret_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          registry: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY }}
          repo: monitoringapp
          region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}
          tags: latest,${{ github.run_number }}
          daemon_off: false
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ./

  Deploy:
    needs: BUILD_AND_PUBLISH
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Code checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}

      - name: Fill in the new image ID in the Amazon ECS task definition
        id: task-def
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition@v1
        with:
          task-definition: ${{ env.ECS_TASK_DEFINITION }}
          container-name: ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME}}
          image: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.ECS_REPOSITORY }}:${{ github.run_number }}
    
      - name: Deploy Amazon ECS task definition
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
        with:
          task-definition: ${{ steps.task-def.outputs.task-definition }}
          service: ${{ env.ECS_SERVICE }}
          cluster: ${{ env.ECS_CLUSTER }}
          wait-for-service-stability: true    
```

After updating your workflow, push the code to GitHub and alert should have been triggered. Wait for some minutes in order the workflow to complete successfully!

![workflow](images/workflow.png)

After that open your ECR -> Repositories -> Images. You should see your images (latest,etc.)

![image-tag](images/image-tag.png)

You can also check your Image URI from your ECS Cluster -> Tasks

![image-uri](images/image-uri-task.png)


## **Part 5: Delete your AWS ECS Cluster**

Go to your AWS ECS Cluster -> Service -> Delete your Service -> Delete your Cluster
You can keep your ECR Repo, Security Groups, ect. You won`t get charged for that.
